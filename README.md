## ab://ander/Installation

### Step 1: Download the Repository

Clone this repository, install the dependencies and create your `.env` file.

    $ git clone https://github.com/aBillander/aBillander.git
    $ composer install

You may also install via <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/aBillander/aBillander/archive/refs/heads/master.zip">zip</a>, extract to any of your folders you wish, and install dependencies after that.

Copy file `.env.example` to `.env` and you are ready to go.

### Step 2: Run the Installer

Head to http://mywebsite.test and the installer will start automatically. You will be asked to provide:

> Email credentials (SMPT server). You can skip this step and modify your `.env` file later on.

> Database credentials. Database should exist, and be empty.

> Your company data and first Administrator User.

The Installer will create all database tables for you, and populate with some handy values, such as Languages, Currencies, Taxes, and more.
